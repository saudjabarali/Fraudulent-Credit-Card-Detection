💳 Fraudulent Credit Card Detection
🔍 Overview

A machine learning classification project designed to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using highly imbalanced data. The project applies preprocessing, feature engineering, class balancing techniques, and multiple ML models to identify suspicious transactions effectively.

🧠 Key Features

Handling of extremely imbalanced datasets

Data preprocessing and feature selection

Class balancing using SMOTE

Training multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Evaluation using Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC

Visualization of fraud vs non-fraud patterns

🧰 Tech Stack

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

SMOTE (imblearn)

Matplotlib / Seaborn

⚠️ Dataset Notice

The original credit card dataset is large (>25MB) and cannot be uploaded to GitHub.
This repository contains a 300-row sample dataset (sample_creditcard.csv) that preserves the structure and pattern distribution required for testing and demonstration purposes.

Do not use this sample for actual model benchmarking.
